# Code Refactor Starter Code
This was my first weekly challenge for my coding bootcamp at Berkeley. Everything edited was mostly for accessiblity. I added semantic tags, sectioned both HTML and CSS code using comments, fixed the Anchor tag for 'Search Engine Optimization', made the CSS code more concise by combining classes together, and created 'alt' tags for every image.
